# Awesome Charity Ideas [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

### Effective Altruism

A lot of people haven't heard of effective altruism, [Haseeb](https://haseebq.com/about/) Qureshi [explains it here very eloquently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NAx7733Sm8&t=1861s).

### Referral bonuses

If you have a friend at a company that offers a referral bonus, do not apply through the website, ask your friend if they would like the opportunity to get thousand(s) of dollars to their favorite charity. If they say no you can find someone else at that same company to agree with this. Make sure to do this before going through any recruiters to find a job as well.


#### README Badges

A lot of repositories have a ['Buy Me a Coffee'](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) badge, you can put an e.g. [![AMF](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-Charity-orange.svg)](https://secure.givewell.org/) badge for some effective altruism charity.

Open Questions: how can we make a link with a pre-filled form with a default 10 dollar amount, and, to make it effortless for the highest number of people, a 'Pay with Amazon' button. (Or something else like that.) Could we work with [Givewell](https://www.givewell.org/) to develop this?


### Social Media Campaigns

Donating publicly inspires other people to donate as well.

## Crazy Ideas

These need some subject matter experts to weigh in on.

### Another persons charity match

Almost all people do not max their charity match, but would be happy to if you gave them the money to donate on your behalf.

We need a grass-roots way of connecting people who want to give their charity match away with effective altruists, prerrably in-person. And standardized ways for attestation (proof of donation) to be given, with that said, if 1 out of 5 people are fraudsters, this still works to great affect in turning 5k to 8k.


Open questions: Is this legally fraud? What kind? What is the statue of limitations on it? Have there been any previous cases of prosecutions for this kind of crime? What was the sentence?

How can we have proof, prefferably straight from the charity, that person X donated Y dollars? How hard is it for someone to get their money back after publically donating on Facebook? What are the ways to verify authenticity of a Facebook donations receipt, bank statement, or e.g. a "your employer matched" benevity email?

Could we legally set up a 501c3, such that, we recieve money from person A, and funnel person B's money to person A? It seems would probably open the 501c3 up to liability, a decentralized grass-roots movement would be more efficient.

### Software Licenses

[Careware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careware) has been an idea since the late 80s, the most well-known example being [Vim](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html#license).

We need a modern-day effective altruism version of this. Both a GPL-compatible one (donation optional), and a perpetual license (required one-time donation) that only applies to commercial use.


Open questions: What would happen if someone like [Kenneth Reitz](https://github.com/kennethreitz) switched the next major version of all their projects to be a required one-time 10$ donation for any commercial use. Is that allowed? Given everything that depends on e.g. [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests), would that break the Internet? Are there unexpected issues with this that explain why almost nobody uses careware licenses?
